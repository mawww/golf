Kakoune vimgolf challenges
==========================

Here are some vimgolf challenges along with their Kakoune solutions.

These benchmarks serve as regressions tests and as a comparison against vim.

Each challenge directory contains am in-, out- and cmd-file. In- and out-files
are directly copied from vimgolf websites, the cmd-file contains the keys
used to solve the challenge.

For ease of comparison, we use a special mapping ',q' for :wq<ret>, which mimics
the vim ZZ binding.

* The `golf.sh` script runs the challenges in current directory and displays
  results.
* The `vgscore.sh` script retrieves the current top scores from the vimgolf website.
  Run it first so that `golf.sh` can display a comparison.
* The `vgdl.sh` script retrieves a challenge from the vimgolf.com website
